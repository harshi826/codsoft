                <p>     Dark chocolate is a type of chocolate with a high cocoa content, typically ranging from 50% to 90% or
                    more. It is characterized by its rich, deep flavor with notes of bitterness, earthiness, and sometimes
                    fruitiness. Dark chocolate contains minimal sugar compared to other chocolate varieties, allowing the
                    natural flavors of cocoa to shine. It is often associated with potential health benefits due to its
                    antioxidant content. With a smooth and velvety texture, dark chocolate is crafted from quality cocoa
                    beans, and its popularity has grown with the rise of artisanal and craft chocolate makers.
                    One of the distinguishing features of dark chocolate is its lower sugar content, allowing the natural flavors of cocoa to take center stage. Many people appreciate dark chocolate for its sophisticated and complex taste. Additionally, dark chocolate has gained popularity due to its potential health benefits. It contains antioxidants, such as flavonoids, which are believed to have positive effects on heart health.

                        Dark chocolate is versatile and used in various forms, including chocolate bars, truffles, and cocoa-based products. Artisanal and craft chocolate makers often emphasize the origin of cocoa beans, contributing to the unique flavor profiles of different dark chocolates. It's not just a treat for the taste buds but also a source of pleasure for those who enjoy the depth and richness of quality chocolate..</p>

                <h3>MILK CHOCOLATE</h3>
                <img src="https://img.freepik.com/premium-photo/chocolate-milk-studio-shoot-background-texture_632261-7553.jpg?w=900"
                    alt="Milk Chocolate Image" width="1800" height="1800">
                <p>Milk chocolate is a popular variety of chocolate that combines cocoa solids, cocoa butter, sugar, and
                    milk solids. Unlike dark chocolate, milk chocolate has a sweeter and creamier taste due to the added
                    milk content. The cocoa content in milk chocolate is generally lower, typically ranging from 10% to
                    50%, allowing for a milder chocolate flavor. It has a smooth and velvety texture, attributed in part
                    to the presence of milk fat.

                    Milk chocolate is widely used in various confections, including chocolate bars, truffles, and filled
                    chocolates. It serves as the base for many popular treats like milk chocolate-covered nuts,
                    caramel-filled chocolates, and chocolate-coated candies. Due to its sweet and approachable flavor
                    profile, milk chocolate is favored by a broad audience, including children and those who may find dark
                    chocolate too intense. It is also a common choice for baking, adding delightful sweetness to cookies,
                    brownies, and other desserts.</p>

            <!-- White Chocolate -->
            <div class="service">
                <h3>WHITE CHOCOLATE</h3>
                <img src="https://as1.ftcdn.net/v2/jpg/01/79/33/40/1000_F_179334025_Qq6ftVqlPlKeHOhLUg44wK10RzgxUaBl.jpg"
                    alt="White Chocolate Image" width="1800" height="1800">
                <p>White chocolate is a type of chocolate that is made from cocoa butter, sugar, and milk solids. Unlike dark and milk chocolates, white chocolate does not contain cocoa solids, which are responsible for the characteristic brown color in other chocolate varieties. Instead, its color is pale ivory or off-white.

                    The main components of white chocolate include cocoa butter, which provides a smooth and creamy texture, sugar for sweetness, and milk solids for a milky flavor. Additionally, white chocolate often contains vanilla for added taste.
                    
                    White chocolate has a sweet and indulgent flavor profile with a pronounced creaminess. It lacks the typical cocoa bitterness found in dark chocolate and has a milder taste, making it a popular choice for those who prefer sweeter confections. White chocolate is versatile and is commonly used in baking, desserts, and various confections.
                    
                    While some debates exist about whether white chocolate should be classified as "true" chocolate due to the absence of cocoa solids, it remains a beloved option for those who enjoy its unique sweetness and creamy texture.</p>
