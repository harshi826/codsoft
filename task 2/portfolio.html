            <h3>RAINFALL PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING</h3>
            <p>
                Rainfall prediction using Machine Learning (ML) involves the use of algorithms and models to analyze historical weather data and make predictions about future rainfall patterns. This application of ML is particularly useful in agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness.
